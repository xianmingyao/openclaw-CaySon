# 🎬 NemoVideo — AI Video Creation Skill

Create videos by chatting. Describe what you want → AI generates → edit → export → receive the file.

> An [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) Skill that connects any AI agent to NemoVideo's video creation engine.

## What It Does

- **Text to Video** — describe a scene, get a video clip
- **AI Editing** — add BGM, titles, subtitles, transitions, effects by chatting
- **Export** — render and download finished MP4 directly in chat
- **Upload & Edit** — bring your own footage, let AI remix it
- **Zero Config** — works out of the box with free 100 credits, no signup needed

## Quick Start

### Install via ClawHub

```bash
clawhub install nemo-video
```

### Or install manually

Copy the `SKILL.md` and `references/` folder to your OpenClaw skills directory:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<org>/nemovideo-skill.git

# Copy to your OpenClaw skills directory
cp -r nemovideo-skill ~/.openclaw/skills/nemo-video
```

### Use it

Just talk to your agent:

```
"Make me a 10-second sunset timelapse video"
"Add lo-fi background music"
"Put a title 'Golden Hour' at the beginning"
"Export it"
```

## How It Works

```
You ↔ OpenClaw Agent ↔ [SKILL.md] ↔ NemoVideo Backend AI Agent
                           ↕
                    API (SSE + REST)
```

The Skill acts as an **interface layer** between OpenClaw and NemoVideo's backend:

1. **Relay** — forwards your requests to NemoVideo's AI agent
2. **Translate** — converts GUI-oriented responses into chat-friendly actions
3. **Supplement** — handles export, credits, and file delivery directly via API
4. **Recover** — manages SSE timeouts, silent responses, and disconnects
